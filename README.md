# Generate-Tv-Scripts-using-RNNs

In this project, we generate new Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We use a part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we have built generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

We can train the network with any TV series scripts and generate new scripts.
